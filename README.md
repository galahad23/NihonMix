Reads all J-Track sepcific items from spotify and play them in an android app

Developing this app specifically for J-Tracks Genre so people with this specific taste don't have to browse the
genre browser in spotify

General development flow is to link app with spotify first then will continue one by one from UI/UX Design, to
how to get the specific genre from API, then display the albums, songs, premade playlists in the app and finally
put in an algorithm where the app will create a custom weekly recommendation for its user

This readme file will be updated with each phase
